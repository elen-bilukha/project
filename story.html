                Hi, Molly, how have you been? As you might guess, I have popped into my town to see my parents. 
                
                And they looked exhausted from daily arguing and as a result made the decision to reunite again. 
                
                No tormenting drifting apart anymore. And I said it out loud to reassure myself in this as well. 
                
                Any way, I am not going to keep fixing on it as this family issue is often spotted everywhere. 
                
                It is obviously cool to meditate upon eternal, but I don't want to slurp this shit reality like couples' troubles. 
                
                And I have run into Him. You know who I mean. Molly, he is living a humdrum life there being permanently drunk. 
                
                The man in his beginning of the 30th living like a damn. 
                
                Well, he is a deranged pig. And I pity for him. This is what his life has caused to him. I expected him to grub away...unmet expectations.
                
                 Does it look familiar to you? When your vision is obscured by clouds you became careless and vulnerable. 
                
                And what is more you are no longer pristine. We had better drop this subject so far.
                
                Seeing him wasn't the emotions of a life-time, but he witnessed me going to my aunt and rapidly got out of his house to show himself up. 
                
                I saw he did it intentionally, I noticed in a distance his eager look as he was watching me through the fence, where all of a sudden jumped over to be absolutely visible for me. 
                
                And I got embarrassed and just gave a brief wave to what he gave me back too.
                
                 If previously my first impulse could be 'Hold me tightly, I so missed you', so now I see the man who looked wrecked and scared to get hurt again.
                
                In the evening He typed me a message. It was a blissful 'Hello! How are u going' and his apologies for his drunk condition as if he cared about my feelings by telling me he didn't feel like texting under the influence of alcohol.
                
                He actually could say nothing, but what I saw in his eyes was a pain, a certain remorse and a sorrow. 
                
                The other day I caught him with Molly. What a coincidence! What a surprise! Molly waved me with a relief and a grid mentioning It was ok and he would get out of my head. 
                
                As you can see, Molly was my offense to him for what he finally apologized. 
                
                Yes, Molly, karmic relationship is when you can't find your mind peaceful due to taking the deep excruciating offense to somebody. And you are ready to cross the biggest border oversees, to fight the biggest fights, but recover your poise. 
                
                Another day I left.
                
                Hope you will care of him and  won't torment long.</p>
