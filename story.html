            <p>Molly, I know you don’t exist, but I am to tell you what is beating me. He is back. First, I didn’t pay any cloying attention, but after 5 weeks (I checked it from the data of adding time) I have been feeling crash on him. I am absolutely mad as if I am conjured up for thinking of him. He made me suffer 5 years ago by doing the things I won’t dare to tell you, because it was not the noble actions as men are supposed to do. He is back. I found out he was watching my photos at night on the second of November. After he added me. I even accepted, but like I said, I didn’t pay any cloying attention until now when I got to feel somebody is feeding on me. He is stealing my energy. He is present. Believe it or not, but I feel he is back on purpose that’s why he let me know he is there. Molly, if you ever heard about karmic relationship, that’s right here. I swear before I had no clue what it was like at all. Women are the source of energy in particular sexual energy. Men are feeding on us. That’s why some men reach their goals faster and succeed all of a sudden. I remember him telling me he is attracted by me, although out families forbid us to get in touch. But one night 5 years ago he crawled to me like a snake to temptate me and I refused. His infatuation lasts many years and lingers even when I am in marriage. He can’t simply assuage as long as he lives out his immaculate dream. Molly, I am living like being watched and being spiritually robbed. Why did he find me? – Simply so. Why did he add me? – Simply so. I have to be reasonable and sensible we are living different cities, non-similar lives, but does woman’s intuition fail me? He is back for me, he wants me to think of him, because while I am keeping him in mind, he is getting my energy and I am devastated. Molly, he is a parasite. 

                Hello, Molly. I am just to say I have blocked my page on Messager so that to be shown always off. It worked for two days after he figured it out and paid me back the same so he is invisible now as well as me. We are hiding from each other, but we are kindly aware of each other’s presence in here. I am simply dying from the suspense he pulled me in so ruthlessly. This is a complete madness. I couldn’t sleep this night and my husband, Tommy, in his sleepy tone asked me where I was going to. And I calmed his down by answering that it was hard to sleep after that huge mug of his coffee so I went to the kitchen to amuse myself. But I lied. I haven’t been able to fall asleep since his presence in my media. Look, I am just going crazy. It is just a man who liked the girl he knew before and just…We were neighbors. And he always kept on watching me, he might get used to it, enjoying that like a freak. I have no idea. Molly, I need a helping hand, because something goes wrong, but what? He stopped liking me after I marked his post with my like. But this is where it hasn’t finished yet, I feel. Help me! I am being manipulated or somewhat.
                Tuesday. 24th.
                Molly, It’s me. Recently I became to feel better. I got an ease that let me work clearly and remain sober. Molly, I love my Tommy form the bottom of my heart and once in a while that is today we have had an amazing sex. But I saw Him again in my dreams I mean I had a vision of our intercourse with Him. It sounds weird, I know, but I gained the consolation when it was morning. And I just transmit all that delight onto my husband. It goes well as it is meant to be. As for him, he has been maintaining silence for 4 days. He pretended to be off, but I noticed a post appeared 3 minutes ago when he was supposed to be off. After he stopped doing like this, perhaps, he guessed I figured it out. I am smart enough to be deceived. Well, the man keeping track of me made me a stalker. What sort of shit connects and gravitates us. And I must confess I am going to see my parents so I move there, right where he is solving me like a riddle. I have taken a ticket. But Molly, look, he is quiet for pretty long, why? He got the clue I noticed Him and it has become uninteresting or what? I long for a good conversation with a proper shrink, I have to care of my state. Once I really admit that it may be because of my suppressed wish to be with the man I wanted to in my childhood. What kind of strings we played being in 5 years ago. Well, I was around 16. I was too young to understand something profoundly. Now I am a little older and conscious to find out the reason of that unhealthy infatuation. The one thing I know for sure it serves Him pleasure when I am on and I am on again. After seeing a shrink, I will go there and let you know.
                
                At the shrink. Wednesday, 25th.
                Mr. Stone has cleared it up for me. My former neighbor is sick, now I know. I am not less sick as him since I am allowing him to mock me. Molly, you need to know that, you need to know the truth. Mr. Stone pitied to say me that the first relationship I got physically was a vicious manipulation over me that brought satisfaction to him. And this man strives for the same. So, I was right about feeding on me. The therapist said the man appeared again to bend me to the will of his. While that one is hiding, it doesn’t hint on looking for serious family business, but gaming that contents him. Dependent women for such freaks are worth its weight in gold. And I am feeling blue, because I am a perfect victim to be so vulnerable and touchy about his every trick. I have to sort it out. Mr. Stone said that presumably I could like that playing in past if now I still react to it. The most visible technic is the strategy of near – far. He gets closer and makes you think of him, when it is reached, he is going scatter and to ground waiting for your suffering and looking for him. That is how madness works. I must have will of steel to put an end to it. Really, now I don’t feel like going there. But I swore to my parents. 
                
                <p> Thursday 26th.
                I am speculating about my arrival home and I see the only possible outcome. I am meeting my gloomy mum who detests all the world, because my dad cheat on her once or not once, who knows, but it serves her as she was the first who betrayed him. She is always so deranged and negative about men so I’d better omit any probable discussions. They have changed crucially and I see no twinkle in their eyes. In my past mum was my only ally…We shared everything regardless of different views or ages…We used to be the closest friends, but now she has turned into taciturn woman going on 43. I am not like mum, I rather exceed her and I am not going to stop since homestead is not my purpose. And Molly, mums are treasures and precious things we have got and she is just in despair feeling low and I must assist her providing my support. Molly, if I am departing there, this is only because of my mum. What comes to him, he is off certainly, but another new post has been done, this is a joke kind of easy-going shit, but I dared to have a look undercover and I treat it is like a useless stuff for puny guys who are drunk after particular occasions. I wouldn’t pay any attention if not my name in this video. One more coincidence? Alright, let it be just an imprudent confuse. But this is how it started 5 years ago. Does he want to remain me the night when after 2 years tracking me he approached unexpectedly. So, Molly, in the dead of night I couldn’t sleep, it was something between summer or autumn and I got out of house and sitting on the bench was listening to music as a huge man’s silhouette stood next to me in no time. I clearly remembered the first question ‘Are u waiting for someone?” and I replayed “No…Just…”. And he interrupted me with rude gross utterance as like “What the holly shit are u doing? For what, damn, are you doing that?” It shocked me and honesty I was scared of the suspense and where it might lead me. He meant the disgrace I was supposed to put on him. I defended myself by asking what he meant and why should I have done something to him. I don’t know how it turned into kissing me and my neck so passionately. Now I have no doubts my family was involved, my mum could have done that. So, presumably, his attraction to me was even stronger than the offence he was taking for so long. All I remember is those affectionate kisses and how he said I gravitate him and sort of feelings. After his tries to give him more of me…like “If u don’t, Why do you think I cannot force you?” And that was the most humiliating me thing so I asked him off. He went and from the middle of the road turned back to me and said “Approach for the last time, please” and I did. And he held me rapidly as high as his face and kissed me again and striving for my change “Are you sure I must leave you?” –“Yes! A I am”. This was where we ended it up and broke the line of suspense.  </p>
